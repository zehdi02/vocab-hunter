# Vocab Hunter

Simple overview of use/purpose.

## Description

Vocab Hunter (VH) is a language learning web application that aids language learners with the acquisition of vocabulary with any text content they want to read.
Language learners often forget words they encountered when studying or reading, so Vocab Hunter is here to help the learner by easily keeping track of the words they learned, the user’s familiarity of the word, and the word’s definition and uses.
